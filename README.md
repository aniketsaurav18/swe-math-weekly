# SWE Math Weekly

[SWE Math Weekly](https://arpitbhayani.me/math) is a fun, hands-on weekly challenge that will
require you to solve a question through code and in the process understand a set of math
concepts - from linear algebra, statistics, and calculus. Here's how it will work,

1. on friday, I'll post an easy or mid-level problem (cp-style)
2. solve it over the weekend, dig deeper into the math concepts
3. on wednesday, I'll share the code, some notes, and maybe even a video explaining the problem.

The problems won't just be random theoretical math exercises. I'll focus on topics that are actually and commonly used in AI, ML, and other advanced domains.

## What's in here?

This repository contains solutions to the problems from [SWE Math Weekly](https://arpitbhayani.me/math).
To get started:  

1. clone the repository
2. navigate to the directory of the solution you need
3. follow the instructions in its README.md file

## How you can contribute?

The solutions to the questions are done mostly on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
You can contribute to this initiative by enriching the notebooks

1. find bugs in the solution and raise with patches
2. polish the notebook and add relevant detailed sections
3. add explanations of core concepts and functionalitites in the notebook
